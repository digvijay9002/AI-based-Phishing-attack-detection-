How does phishing work?
 * Phishing starts with a fraudulent email or other communication that is designed to lure a victim. The message is made to look as though it comes from a trusted        sender. If it fools the victim, he or she is coaxed into providing confidential information, often on a scam website. Sometimes malware is also downloaded onto the    target’s computer.

 * Today we’ll focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).
   Besides analyzing and categorizing email the moment it arrives, AI can do so on a larger scale much faster and more accurately when compared to the traditional        model based on rules and filters.
 * Using database and big data analysis, it identifies spam, phishing, spear phishing, and other types of attacks by taking into account the message content and          context.



Requirement of System: 

Hardware Requirements: 
 * Processor CPU - Intel Pentium Dual Core and Higher 
 * Hard Disk capacity - 512MB Space required minimum
 * RAM - 4GB minimum

Software requirements
 * Programming language - Python 
 * Operating system - Windows 8.1 or above 
 * Google Colab, IDE - Anaconda , Python version 3.x


Common Techniques to detect phishing attack: 

 (1)Content analysis
 (2)Sender analysis
 (3)URL analysis
 (4)Behavioural analysis
 (5)Machine learning



Challenges

* Finding the appropriate dataset.
* Feature extraction required the study of various modules and understanding each module and getting the expected outcome from it.



Conclusion / Future Work: 

 * The proposed method used four machine learning classifiers to achieve this and a comparative study of the four algorithms was made. 
 * A good accuracy score was also achieved. 
 * The four algorithms used are Logistic Regression ,K-Nearest neighbour, Support Vector Machine, and Conclusion & future works Detection of phishing websites using      machine learning techniques decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier.
 * The accuracy score might vary while using other datasets and other algorithms might provide better accuracy than random forest classifier.
 * Random forest classifier is an ensemble classifier and hence the high accuracy.This model can be deployed in real time to detect the URLs as phishing or legitimate.
